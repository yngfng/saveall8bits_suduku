Entry in PyWeek #18

Team: some_game  
Members: jimmybob

DEPENDENCIES:
------------

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  * Python:     <http://www.python.org/> (tested with 2.7)  
  * PyGame:     <http://www.pygame.org/> (tested with 1.9.1)

RUNNING THE GAME:
----------------

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and type:

    $ python run_game.py

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
--------------------

Follow the in game tutorial system.  The game is played with the mouse
only. Click on the tutorial text to advance the tutorial, or click on
the flashing cell on the board.

It is probably best to turn the tutorial off on the menu screen
when/if you start playing 'for real'.

High scores are saved locally.

There are 8 levels, and it is possible to save all 8 bits in every
level (don't ask me what the minimum number of moves is though).
